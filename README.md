## ðŸ”¹ How Program ID & Deployment Wallet Are Connected  
- The **Program ID (`7LwZn...`)** is tied to the **initial deployment**.  
- The **Developer Wallet (`6onyn...`)** is the **upgrade authority** for the contract.  
- If a different wallet deploys, **a new Program ID is created**, resulting in a new contract.  
- Using the same **wallet & keypair** ensures all team members interact with the **same contract**.
